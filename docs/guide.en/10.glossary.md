# Glossary

## A

### AUTO Mode
A type of commit mode. Each write operation is immediately reflected to disk.
This is the default setting, which minimizes risk of data loss but may degrade performance during bulk writes.

```java
// AUTO mode (default)
FxStore store = FxStore.open(path);
map.put(key, value);  // Immediately saved to disk
```

## B

### B-Tree
A balanced tree data structure for storing sorted key-value data.
Used in the internal implementation of FxStore's NavigableMap and NavigableSet.

### BATCH Mode
A type of commit mode. Changes are reflected to disk only when `commit()` is called.
Good performance for bulk writes, but data since last commit may be lost on crash.

```java
FxOptions options = FxOptions.defaults()
    .withCommitMode(CommitMode.BATCH)
    .build();
FxStore store = FxStore.open(path, options);

map.put(key, value);  // Not yet saved to disk
store.commit();       // Now saved to disk
```

## C

### Codec
A component that serializes (encodes) and deserializes (decodes) objects to/from byte arrays.
Implements the `FxCodec<T>` interface.

**Built-in Codecs**:
- `Long`, `Integer`, `Short`, `Byte`
- `Double`, `Float`
- `String`
- `byte[]`

### Collection
A data structure identified by name within a Store.
One of NavigableMap, NavigableSet, List, or Deque.

### COW (Copy-on-Write)
A copy-on-write strategy. Creates a new version by copying existing data on modification.
The original remains unchanged, so it doesn't affect transactions currently reading.
A core mechanism for guaranteeing crash consistency.

### Commit
The action of permanently saving changes to disk.
Automatic in AUTO mode, requires calling `store.commit()` in BATCH mode.

### Crash Consistency
The property of maintaining data in a consistent state even after a system crash.
FxStore can always recover to the last successfully committed state through COW.

## D

### Deque
A double-ended queue. Elements can be added/removed from both front and back.
Implements the `java.util.Deque` interface.

### Durability
The property that committed data is not lost even in case of system failure.
- `SYNC`: Immediate synchronization (safe but slow)
- `ASYNC`: Asynchronous synchronization (fast but recent data may be lost on crash)

## F

### FxCodec
An interface for defining serialization/deserialization of custom types.

```java
public interface FxCodec<T> {
    String id();
    int version();
    byte[] encode(T value);
    T decode(byte[] bytes);
    int compareBytes(byte[] a, byte[] b);
    boolean equalsBytes(byte[] a, byte[] b);
    int hashBytes(byte[] bytes);
}
```

### FxOptions
A builder pattern class for defining Store configuration.
Configures commit mode, durability, page size, etc.

### FxReadTransaction
A read-only transaction. Provides consistent reads by fixing a snapshot at start time.

```java
try (FxReadTransaction tx = store.beginRead()) {
    String value = tx.get(map, key);
}
```

### FxStore
The main interface of FxStore.
Provides store opening/closing, collection creation/opening, commit control, etc.

## L

### List
An ordered collection accessed by index.
Implements the `java.util.List` interface.

## M

### Memory Mode
A mode that stores only in memory instead of disk.
Can be opened with `FxStore.openMemory()`. Suitable for testing or temporary storage.

## N

### NavigableMap
A sorted key-value map. Supports range queries and navigation methods.
Implements the `java.util.NavigableMap` interface.

### NavigableSet
A sorted set. Supports range queries and navigation methods.
Implements the `java.util.NavigableSet` interface.

## P

### Page
The basic unit of disk I/O. Can be selected from 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, or 64K.
Larger page sizes are advantageous for large data but waste space for small data.

## R

### Rollback
Cancels changes since last commit in BATCH mode.

```java
store.rollback();
```

## S

### Snapshot
The state of data at a specific point in time.
Read transactions reference the snapshot at their start time.

### Store
The storage unit of FxStore. Corresponds to one file or memory region.
Can contain multiple collections.

## T

### Transaction
A logical grouping of a series of operations.
FxStore supports read transactions (`FxReadTransaction`).
Writes are handled by automatic commits in AUTO mode or explicit commits in BATCH mode.

## V

### Verify
The action of checking the integrity of a Store.

```java
VerifyResult result = store.verify();
if (result.isOk()) {
    System.out.println("Store is healthy");
}
```
