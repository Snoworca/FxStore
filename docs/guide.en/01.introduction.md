# FxStore Introduction

## What is FxStore?

FxStore is a **Java 8-based single-file persistent collection library**.

It implements standard Java collection interfaces (`NavigableMap`, `NavigableSet`, `List`, `Deque`) while **persistently storing data in a single file**.

```java
// Use like regular Java code
FxStore store = FxStore.open(Paths.get("data.fx"));
NavigableMap<Long, String> users = store.createOrOpenMap("users", Long.class, String.class);

users.put(1L, "Alice");
users.put(2L, "Bob");

store.close();

// Data persists after restart
store = FxStore.open(Paths.get("data.fx"));
users = store.openMap("users", Long.class, String.class);
System.out.println(users.get(1L));  // "Alice"
```

## Key Features

### Zero-Dependency
No external dependencies at all. Uses only the Java 8 standard library.
Just add a single JAR file and you're ready to go.

### Single-File Storage
All data is stored in **one file**.
- Backup: Copy one file
- Move: Move one file
- Delete: Delete one file

### Crash Consistency
Based on **COW (Copy-on-Write)**, data consistency is guaranteed even in case of crashes.
Always recovers to the last successfully committed state.

### Java Collections API Compatible
Directly implements `NavigableMap`, `NavigableSet`, `List`, `Deque` interfaces.
Easy to integrate into existing Java code.

## Supported Collections

| Collection | Interface | Use Case |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Map** | `NavigableMap<K, V>` | Key-value storage, range queries, sorted order |
| **Set** | `NavigableSet<E>` | Unique elements, range queries, sorted order |
| **List** | `List<E>` | Index-based access, order preservation |
| **Deque** | `Deque<E>` | Double-ended queue, used as Stack/Queue |

## Supported Types (Built-in Codecs)

Types available out-of-the-box without additional configuration:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Long` | 64-bit integer |
| `Integer` | 32-bit integer |
| `Short` | 16-bit integer |
| `Byte` | 8-bit integer |
| `Double` | 64-bit floating point |
| `Float` | 32-bit floating point |
| `String` | UTF-8 string |
| `byte[]` | Byte array |

Custom types can be registered by implementing the `FxCodec` interface.

## When to Use?

### Suitable Use Cases

- **Embedded database**: Data storage without a separate server
- **Local cache**: Cache that persists after application restart
- **Configuration/state storage**: Application settings, user preferences
- **Log/event storage**: Time-series data, event logs
- **Task queue**: Persistent message queue, job queue
- **Testing/prototyping**: Rapid development and testing

### Unsuitable Use Cases

- **Large-scale distributed systems**: Not suitable for distributed environments due to single-file design
- **High concurrency**: Cannot handle multi-process concurrent writes
- **Multi-terabyte scale**: Limited by single-file size constraints
- **Complex queries**: Does not support complex queries like SQL
